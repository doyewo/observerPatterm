The purpose of an observer pattern is so that when one object changes state, all it's dependencies are notified and updated automatically. The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency amonng objects. The Observer interface updates objects which should be notified of changes in a subject.

Test the Observer pattern in:

src/main/java/ObserverPatternTest
